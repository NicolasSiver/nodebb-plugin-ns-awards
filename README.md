## How does it work?

Plugin introduces new entity for your board: Award. It could be anything: ribbon, medal, special rank, etc.

1. Visit Awards control panel in ACP
2. Create several awards, don't forget images.
3. Give awards to the users.
4. If you want to list users' awards, you can augment Profile page template - `profile.tpl`

## ACP Look

## Themes

### Profile template

Use flex template - `awards_profile_flex.tpl` for Persona v4. Place it wherever you like.

```html
<!-- IMPORT partials/awards_profile_flex.tpl -->
```

Use profile partial, it will add small panel with awards as list. Every award item will include: picture, name, reason and date.

Example Vanilla Theme, edit `node_modules/nodebb-theme-vanilla/templates/account/profile.tpl`:

    <!-- IMPORT partials/awards_profile.tpl -->
    
### Topic template

Use topic partial to show awards for every post. Award's metadata is the same as for Profile template.

Example Persona Theme, edit `node_modules/nodebb-theme-persona/templates/partials/topic/post.tpl`:

    <!-- IMPORT partials/awards_topic.tpl -->
